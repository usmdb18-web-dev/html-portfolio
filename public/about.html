<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Derrick.  I am currently working as a network and security
  engineer.  As I look at job postings in my field I am noticing a trend
  of employers inquiring if you have programming skills.  So to stay marketable
  and to continue to be able to a resource  I am currently taking a Web Development and Python class 
  as part of my continous learning path.</p>
